	<h2>Early Life</h2>

     <p>John Dalton was born into a Quaker family in Eaglesfield, near Cockermouth, in Cumberland, England.[1] His father was a weaver.[2] He received his early education from his father and from Quaker John Fletcher,<a href="https://github.com/sarahsga/TK-Tasks/tree/master/html/03-wikipedia">Example</a> who ran a private school in the nearby village of Pardshaw Hall. Dalton's family was too poor to support him for long and he began to earn his living at the age of ten in the service of a wealthy local Quaker, Elihu Robinson.[3] It is said he began teaching at a local school at age 12 and became proficient in Latin at age 14.<a href="https://github.com/sarahsga/TK-Tasks/tree/master/html/03-wikipedia">Example</a>

    <h2>Meteorology</h2>

    <p>Dalton's early life was influenced by a prominent Eaglesfield Quaker, Elihu Robinson,[4] a competent meteorologist and instrument maker, who interested him in problems of mathematics and <a href="https://github.com/sarahsga/TK-Tasks/tree/master/html/03-wikipedia">Example</a> meteorology. During his years in Kendal, Dalton contributed solutions to problems and answered questions on various subjects in The Ladies' Diary and the Gentleman's Diary. In 1787 at age 21 he began his meteorological diary in which, during the succeeding 57 years, he entered more than 200,000 observations.[5] He rediscovered George Hadley's theory of atmospheric circulation (now known as the Hadley cell) around this time.[6] In 1793 Dalton's first publication,<a href="https://github.com/sarahsga/TK-Tasks/tree/master/html/03-wikipedia">Example</a> Meteorological Observations and Essays, contained the seeds of several of his later discoveries but despite the originality of his treatment, little attention was paid to them by other scholars. A second work by Dalton, Elements of English Grammar, was published in 1801.<a href="https://github.com/sarahsga/TK-Tasks/tree/master/html/03-wikipedia">Example</a>
